# COVID-Detection-Using-X-ray
There was one datathon held on DPHI <a href="https://dphi.tech/challenges/data-sprint-15-covid-19-x-ray-dataset/44/overview/about">(about competition)</a>
<br>
The task was of Image Classification. For that competition I used two approaches
<ol><li> Custom CNN</li>
  <li> RamdomForestClassifier</li>
 </ol>
 Where RandomForestClassifier helped me gain 13<sup>th</sup> rank in that competition.
 Later I thought of implementing ResNet50 model on this dataset. This repository contains Jupyter notebook file in which ResNet is implemented.
